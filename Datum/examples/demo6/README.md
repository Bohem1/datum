# Light property Lookup

This demo shows the Use of the Lookup function (also a ScriptToProcess, because Scope), that simplifies the Datum call to Resolve-Datum, and cater for Default value, Error when no value is found.

It will also allow for a second Datum lookup to a DSC Composite Resource's Configuration (Server Side), when there is no result returned from the Global Configuration Data and No Default Specified.
